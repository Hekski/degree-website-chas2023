## Abstract

<br />

<div class="container">
    <figure class="abstract-image">
      <img src="/assets/dashboard.jpg" alt="Dashboard" width="330">
      <figcaption>
        Overview of the dashboard

    </figure>
    <p class="start">This degree project in the subject of web development is about developing a "developer and admin-friendly", modular "Dashboard" with a focus on reusability, readability and scalability for effective future maintenance and further development.</p>
    <p>I have limited the scope of this degree project to be able to further explore and practice improving my structure and modularization skills and experience. I believe this is almost as important and interesting as writing efficient functions and is the foundation of all projects. The work with this dashboard is connected to the company "Bidstacker" where I did my internship during the training and is an extension of their web app.</p>
    <p>I aim to use modern web development techniques and principles within the realm of the React library, to create flexible and reusable components. As part of writing clean and modular code the concept of S.O.L.I.D. is also studied. The tools used are the React framework Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js and MongoDB.</p>
    <p>The goal is to find a natural way to structure and modularize in React.js or in web project structures with reusable functionality.</p>
